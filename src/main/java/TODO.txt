- Make a way to "intercept" or listen for certain packets and add a way to be able to parse and change the data in them
	- This will make it easy to make plugins specifically for connections over this proxy
	
- Custom leave/join messages with players name
	
- Keep track of player objects that contains the players username, position and other information about the player
	- This is sort of an expansion to the two last ideas, it will make custom leave/join messages possible
	and expand the ability for creating custom plugins
	
- IP ban system

- Add a way to "proxy" the socket connections for IP forwarding

- Add a "server_pvn" option to server properties file and add support for multiple versions
	- Ability to change the server PVN (Protocol Version Number), this will make it possible to
	add support for multiple Minecraft versions from a single proxy, I first have to port the packet
	classes for those versions though. 
	**Will most likely only support some of my older ports (a1.2.6, b1.1_02, b1.7.3)**
